      "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \n",
      "for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \n",
      "to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \n",
      "the book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \n",
      "in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \n",
      "if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \n",
      "getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \n",
      "the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \n",
      "it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \n",
      "when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \n",
      "abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \n",
      "upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \n",
      "i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \n",
      "in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \n",
      "it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \n",
      "and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \n",
      "don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \n",
      "now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \n",
      "the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \n",
      "oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \n",
      "even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \n",
      "ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \n",
      "i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \n",
      "the film , however , is all good . \n",
      "2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n",

      "the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \n",

      "apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \n",
      "there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \n",

       "'books could be   and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy   and rightfully so    this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late   s early   s   inspiring literally dozens of clones   from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day   and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre    the special effects were groundbreaking   revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later    literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it    and now   george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy    much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr   lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now    some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection   while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday s star wars updated with today s special effects wizardry    either way   the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen   where it rightfully deserves to be seen    can there be anyone in the world who doesn t know what star wars is about    in a way   star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it    it s a story about a young man s coming of age   a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire   a tale of swashbuckling and derring do the likes of which haven t been seen on the silver screen in decades   strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn   and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world    it s high adventure   incredible special effects   and       well   it s just an  experience     something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation       and  it s about to do so again    this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film s devoted fans   who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now    interviews   trailers   leaks from within lucasfilm       all of these have been collected   collated   and placed on webpages for people to see   pages such as http     www   islandnet   com  corona films details sw    html  or   my personal favorite   http     leopard   cs   latrobe   edu   au  koukoula         pictures of before and after have been placed side by side       even  months before the movies were released   fans were making comparisons    in some cases   the changes were nothing less than phenomenal   and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater    the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here   unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original    for instance   in my personal favorite example   the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep   moss covered carvings and etchings    and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling   booming city   with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing    all the starships and fighters are now computer animated   getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made  and they look  fantastic     four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added   including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in      simply couldn t do it justice    however   much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself    the negatives   badly damaged by the ravages of time   were brightened and returned to their original splendor    the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed   with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt   into glorious   booming   theater shaking full thx dolby digital stereo    and  that    more than the added scenes or new special effects   is where the real value of this new version lies    it s really true what they say in the commercials   star wars loses  so much  on the small screen    even letterboxing doesn t make up for the decrease in size and definition    in regard to the star wars special edition   and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released   i ll make this final recommendation   go and see it    go and see it more than once       it  may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it s gone this time    take along the youngsters who ve never had the big screen star wars experience  you ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time    there s magic in this movie  special edition or no   there can be no denying that it s still star wars   and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages   from four to four hundred    let s all return to that time long ago   and that galaxy far   far away        '"

    "The four models all have AUC more than 80%, that means they all distinguish labels good. The highest one is the model one, which is very close to AUC OF the third model. The third model adds stop_words in the tfidfvectorier parameter but the result shows that it does not have a very big impact. The second model changes penalty from l2 to l1, then it  has relative big difference than others due to the change of penalty term.l1 regularization helps to perform feature selection, but in this case l2 is better. \n",

    "Problem:During the process of runing the model several times, I also found that sometimes the efficacy changes a lot. Just take model one for example, now the AUC is 0.89 but one time it turned to be 0.82.And in that case, the precision and recall decreased to average 0.49. While when I ran it again, it turned to good again. I am not sure whether it's that when spliting the data into train and test, some random test reviews are more easy for the model to classify."
